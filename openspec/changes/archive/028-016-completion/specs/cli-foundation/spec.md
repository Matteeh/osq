# Spec Delta: CLI Foundation

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: OpenSpec layout initialization and template retirement
<!-- source: src/core/init.ts, tests/init.test.ts -->
The project initialization command SHALL scaffold only `openspec/` directories and configuration files, and SHALL NOT create legacy `specs/` directories or `specs/_template/`.

#### Scenario: Scaffolding creates OpenSpec layout only
- **WHEN** user executes `osq init` in a clean directory
- **THEN** system creates `openspec/` directory structure and configuration, leaving `specs/` uncreated

#### Scenario: Legacy specs template absent
- **WHEN** repository scaffolding is inspected
- **THEN** `specs/_template/` does not exist

### Requirement: OpenSpec agent documentation and managed instructions block
<!-- source: src/core/init.ts, README.md, AGENTS.md, tests/managed-blocks.test.ts -->
The project documentation and managed `AGENTS.md` block SHALL describe the OpenSpec layout and execution protocol, SHALL NOT reference retired paths (`features/`, `specs/`, or `drift against features`), and SHALL preserve foreign OpenSpec blocks during setup.

#### Scenario: Managed block contains no retired paths
- **WHEN** `AGENTS.md` or `MANAGED_AGENTS_MD_BODY` is inspected
- **THEN** neither contains references to `features/`, `specs/`, or `drift against features`

#### Scenario: Foreign OpenSpec block preserved during setup
- **WHEN** `osq setup` executes against an `AGENTS.md` containing an OpenSpec managed block
- **THEN** both `<!-- OPENSPEC:START -->` and `<!-- OSQ:START -->` blocks survive unchanged
