# Spec Delta: CLI Foundation

## Purpose

Provides command-line interface entrypoints, configuration loading, leveled logging with an interactive status sink, project scaffolding, repository health diagnostics, and npm package distribution.

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Complete layout consumer cut-over
<!-- source: src/core/layout.ts, src/core/status.ts, src/core/show.ts, src/core/report.ts, src/cli/lint.ts -->
All CLI entrypoints and core workflow commands SHALL derive change and archive directory paths strictly through `src/core/layout.ts` without reading `config.paths.specs` or `config.paths.archive`.

#### Scenario: Status inspection resolves via layout
- **WHEN** user executes `osq status`
- **THEN** command resolves change folders from `getChangesDir(config.paths.openspecRoot, cwd)` and archive count from `getArchiveDir(config.paths.openspecRoot, cwd)`

#### Scenario: Show and report commands resolve via layout
- **WHEN** user executes `osq show` or `osq report`
- **THEN** commands locate spec folders and completed archives using canonical layout helpers
