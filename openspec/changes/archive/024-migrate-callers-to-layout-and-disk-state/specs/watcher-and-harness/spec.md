# Spec Delta: Watcher and Harness

## Purpose

Drives reactive execution of approved tasks: manages exclusive locks, spawns coding agents across harness adapters, executes independent zero-trust verification gates, applies delta specs, and archives completed changes.

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Backward-compatible state derivation and watcher layout cut-over
<!-- source: src/core/state.ts, src/watcher/archiver.ts -->
The state derivation subsystem SHALL support overloaded invocation for both in-memory snapshots and direct project paths, while the watcher archiver resolves destination paths through canonical layout helpers.

#### Scenario: Asynchronous disk-backed state derivation
- **WHEN** callers invoke `deriveSpecState(projectRoot, folderPath)`
- **THEN** function reads change folder snapshot from disk asynchronously and returns the derived `SpecState`

#### Scenario: Archiver uses canonical layout
- **WHEN** watcher completes and archives a change
- **THEN** archive destination path is determined using `getArchiveDir` from `src/core/layout.ts`
